* I am an undergraduate student studying Joint Honours in Computer Science and Biology at McGill University. [[Curriculum Vitae](http://yifnzhao.github.io./files/yifanzhao_cv.pdf)]

* I enjoy writing Python, Java, C++, MATLAB and Bash scripts. My research interests lie in the general area of computational biology, particularly in bio-image analysis and high-throughput genomics, as well as the development and application of machine learning and statistical learning algorithms to solve computational biology problems and answer new biological questions.

* I expect to receive my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in June 2020. My undergraduate research advisors are [Dr. Abigail Gerhold](https://www.gerholdlab.net/people), [Dr. Yojiro Yamanaka](https://mcgillgcrc.com/research/members/yamanaka) and [Dr. Uri David Akavia](https://www.mcgill.ca/biochemistry/about-us/department/faculty-members/uri-david-akavia).
